### TODO
    
    - How-To override the change detection of a given component so that it only reacts to even numbers
    - when are AfterContentChecked and AfterViewChecked called
    - Do an example with immutable.js to see how a section of the tree is bypassed if proper configuration is in place
    
    
### DONE

    - check when event handlers are triggered compared to the life cycle methods
    - find out how the development bundle prevents changes in the view to trigger more changes in the view (enableDevMode)
    - find an example of a change detector function
    - https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/api/core/ChangeDetectorRef-class.html
    - OnPush Demo
